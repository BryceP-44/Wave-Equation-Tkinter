You can demo any of these uploaded files as they are.
From a bouncing 0 dimensional point to a driven vibrating string. Differential equations are actually extremely easy to solve with a computer. Uses the built in python GUI toolkit for graphics.
I recently made a custom 3D graphics formula, so I will be making a 2D wave sheet and a 3D vibrating block soon.
